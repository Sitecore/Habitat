						This is an example of how to configure a Unicorn configuration that, when synced along with Default Configuration,
						will always sync after it because it is a dependency.
						
						Dependencies do NOT force additional configurations to sync. So if you chose to sync only Sample Dependent Configuration,
						it would not automatically sync Default Configuration. Dependency only comes into play when all dependencies are syncing at once,
						or when all configurations sync together.
