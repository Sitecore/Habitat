###How do I contribute?		
When developing a contribution to the project, we suggest using Githubs fork feature. When you have completed your work, please use the Pull Request feature to submit your work back to the project. We will review and comment is necessary and when your contribution is approved, we will add a merge task into our backlog for the next release, this will assure that the new feature goes through the internal test and QA processes.  		
You can read more about the tools here: https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/		
		
In summary:		
 		
1. [Create a fork of the Habitat 'master' branch](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/).		
2. Develop your feature in your own forked repository.		
3. [Submit a pull request back to the 'master' branch](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/).		
4. The team will review and comment on your feature.		
5. If the feature is accepted, the team will submit a task to the internal project backlog to merge in the feature.		
6. Your feature will be distributed a part of the Habitat project - and you will be in the Hall of Fame forever.		
		
###What can I contribute?		
We are looking for all types of features and functionality which makes sense in a Sitecore solution. This means: If you have created a cool feature or functionality on your latest website project, then tell us about it! If you have a module on marketplace which would fit neatly into the project framework, lets have it!  		
		
Your contribution should typically be in the form of a new Feature module in the Domain layer. This means it should extend the functionality of the website. Please make sure that the feature is running in the Habitat website without additional design or layout changes. If you have suggestions for the Framework layer then please let us know too. We are always looking for good stuff.		
		
Please feel free to submit an Issue here on Github describing your idea before, to see if the suggested feature sits well with the project.		
		
Please note:  		
*Generally any requirements on 3rd party commercial software will not be approved*  		
*All parts of your contribution must be complete free of any licensing and free to distribute*  		
*We reserve the right to change the terms of contribution at any time*
