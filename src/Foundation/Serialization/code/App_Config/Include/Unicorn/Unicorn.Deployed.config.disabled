<!--
	Unicorn Deployed Configuration

	This file configures Unicorn to throw up warnings and prompts when saving items that are included by Unicorn.

	This is appropriate to use in a CE environment where Unicorn items are deployed to, as it will warn careless editors to not change items controlled by Unicorn.
	Do not enable this in a development environment.
