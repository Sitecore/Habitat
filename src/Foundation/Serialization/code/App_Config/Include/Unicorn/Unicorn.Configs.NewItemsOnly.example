	Unicorn.Configs.NewItemsOnly.config

	This is an example of how to configure a Unicorn configuration that overrides the default sync behavior
	to only load items that are new on disk into Sitecore. This can be handy if you want to only deploy some content items
	once and thereafter cede control over them to content editors.

	Enabled configuration definition patches should be present on all environments Unicorn is present on.

	See Unicorn.config for commentary on how configurations operate, or https://github.com/kamsar/Unicorn/blob/master/README.md

						This is an example of how to configure a Unicorn configuration that overrides the default Evaluator
						(the code that decides what to do when item differences are found) so that instead of having the disk be the master
						and all changes syncing to that state, only brand new items are synced. Existing items, deleted items, or changed items
						are ignored because we've overridden the default Evaluator.

					<!--
						Note: when using custom evaluators keep Transparent Sync OFF for those configurations (the line below).
						Transparent Sync operates by reading from the serialization store directly.
						In other words transparent sync always acts like SerializedAsMasterEvaluator because disk is LITERALLY the master.
						See https://github.com/kamsar/Unicorn/wiki/The-Transparent-Sync-Guide
