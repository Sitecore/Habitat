	This is an example of how to configure Unicorn to override the location on disk to store the serialized items.

	If used, this should be present on all environments where Unicorn is active (usually all but CD).

						The target data store is where we write serialized items to, use this patch to alter where items are serialized to and from.

						Note the target data store's rootPath can be any of:
						Absolute filesystem path, e.g. c:\foo\bar
						Web-root-relative path, e.g. ~/data/serialization or ~/../out-of-root-serialization
						Data-folder-relative path, e.g. $(dataFolder)\serializedItems

						DO NOT SHARE A ROOT PATH BETWEEN CONFIGURATIONS (at least if you're using SFS).
						They can clobber each other's folders. You may inject the name of the current
						configuration as a variable with $(configurationName).

						The data cache uses a memory cache to store serialized items read from disk. It
						is recommended if using transparent syncing for performance. It's not really
						needed otherwise.
