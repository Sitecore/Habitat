Feature: Mockup of External page

In order to start a demo story from an external page
As a technical presales consultant
I want to be able to show a mockup of an external page, e.g. search engine page with adword links to a campaign on the website

	Given Habitat website is opened on Main Page
	When Actor navigates to Demo site 
	Then URl contains Demo site url
	And Demo site title equals to <Google>
	And Following buttons are present on the Demo site page
	| Goggle page buttons |
	| Google Search       |
	| I'm Feeling Lucky   |

	Given Mockup of Google page is opened
	When Actor enters test search text in to search field
	And Actor clicks Google Search button 
	Then Search results contains following sitelink
