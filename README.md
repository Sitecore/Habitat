# Sitecore Habitat

Habitat is an example Sitecore solution built on the [Helix architecture principles](http://helix.sitecore.net).  It is designed to show how a Helix-based solution can be architected, and to demonstrate how tooling can be used to accomplish publishing, serialization, and testing. Habitat **is not intended** to be a starter solution, or as a requirement on tooling in your solutions.

The architecture and methodology focuses on:

* Simplicity - *A consistent and discoverable architecture*
* Flexibility - *Change and add quickly and without worry*
* Extensibility - *Simply add new features without steep learning curve*

For getting started, please check out the [Documentation](./docs).
