## Submitting Issues
All bug reports and issues **require** a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/). You can take a look at the [contributing guide](https://guides.github.com/overviews/os-contributing/#contributing) here on GitHub too. For demo links, please use things like [CodePen](http://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/), or [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/) to create reduced test cases. For more best practices when contributing, check out [html5boilerplate's guide](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Without a reduced test case, your issue may be closed.
