# How to contribute

This site is a demo site for Sitecore Habitat, which means that contributing to this repository will be treated as updates to the relevant demo site or improvements to the development workflow. Creating more theme files that can be loaded later on or updating the build workflow to a higher/newer standard is much appreciated, but should be done in relation to the following guidelines.

## Structure
The structure in the project is created and maintained in relation to the [Atomic Design](http://patternlab.io/about.html) guidelines, and as such will reflect the structural patterns in relation to that.
File structure is initially generated by the yeoman generator [generator-gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp), but further customized to entail the scope of the project. In relation to the atomic design guidelines, all stylesheet components should be placed inside their respective folder, i.e. atoms in components/atoms, molecules in components/molecules and so on.
The markup should not per say directly reflect the atomic design guidelines, but since bootstrap has a relatively modular approach already, markup will automatically be split into atoms, molecules, organisms and templates/pages.

Nunjuck is used solely to ease the development of different resources, but should NOT be used to attempt abstraction purely for abstraction and/or following the atomic guidelines sake. The implementation of the different atomic elements should be implemented as purely in markup as possible, as the bootstrap guidelines will provide the semantic meaning and the division of different elements into atomic components. An example would be to not attempt abstracting the button tag. Even though this component is essentially an atom, creating a macro or a block for this element is redundant.

Each component, e.g. a button or navigation, should have their own related SASS file located in the categorized directory that it belongs to according to the atomic style guidelines. An example is the <nav> tag or .nav class belongs in an atom. This means that it is represented in components/atoms/_nav.scss.

Development guidelines for theming should be that each theme has it's own root SASS file, and a subfolder containing the before mentioned components folder. In addition, it should also contain a _variables.scss file that should be imported strictly after importing the global variables file, and before importing the bootstrap SASS file from bower.
