        The mythical dragon commands the wind, the mist and the rain, surging through the skies and the seas.<br>
        <br>
        For more than 2,000 years, Dragon Boat racing has had a special place in Chinese culture, with 12-metre long boats battling it out to the pounding of drums. The first races were held to commemorate Qu Yuan, the great warrior poet, who drowned himself in a river as a protest against political corruption. Today, the race represents patriotism and group integrity.<br>
        <br>
        Get up close to all the action on the 90 metre viewing pontoon and watch this heart-stopping competition, as the spectacular dragon boats race through the waters to the pounding of drums and the cheering of spectators.<br>
        <br>
        Come and see a unique Taoist eye dotting ceremony and the blessing the waters to ensure a safe weekend of racing, and awakening of the dragons by dabbing red paint onto the eyes of each boat&rsquo;s figurehead.<br>
        <br>
        Meet St.George&rsquo;s Happy Dragon who will also be cheering on the dragon boats over the weekend.<br>
        <br>
        Brought to you by St.George.&nbsp;
