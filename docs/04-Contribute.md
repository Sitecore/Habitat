## How do I contribute?

When developing a contribution to the project, we suggest using Githubs fork feature. When you have completed your work, please use the Pull Request feature to submit your work back to the project. We will review and comment is necessary and when your contribution is approved, we will add a merge task into our backlog for the next release, this will assure that the new feature goes through the internal test and QA processes.
You can read more about the tools here: [https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/)

In summary:

1. [Create a fork of the Habitat 'master' branch](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/).
1. Develop your feature in your own forked repository.
1. [Submit a pull request back to the 'master' branch](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/).
1. The team will review and comment on your feature.
1. If the feature is accepted, the team will submit a task to the internal project backlog to merge in the feature.
1. Your feature will be distributed a part of the Habitat project - and you will be in the Hall of Fame forever.

## What can I contribute?

At this time we are not looking to expand the features or functionalities of Habitat. This means we are not looking for new Feature or Foundation modules.
We are always interested in bug fixes, optimizations or refactorings - so please keep those coming. Also upgrades of dependencies are interesting.

If you are convinced that a feature or foundation module is missing in the project, please feel free to submit an Issue here on Github describing your idea before, to see if the idea sits well with the project.

Please note:

* *Generally any requirements on 3rd party commercial software will not be approved*
* *Any dependencies on other non-commercial software must be founded on a community wide "standard"*
* *All parts of your contribution must be complete free of any licensing and free to distribute*
* *We reserve the right to change the terms of contribution at any time*
