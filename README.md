# Sitecore Habitat

Habitat is an example Sitecore solution built on the [Helix architecture principles](http://helix.sitecore.net). It is designed to show how a Helix-based solution can be architected, and to demonstrate how tooling can be used to accomplish publishing, serialization, and testing. Habitat **is not intended** to be a starter solution, or as a recommendation of tools for your solutions.

The architecture and methodology focuses on:

* Simplicity - *A consistent and discoverable architecture*
* Flexibility - *Change and add quickly and without worry*
* Extensibility - *Simply add new features without steep learning curve*

For getting started, please check out the [Documentation](./docs).  
For more information on **Helix**, please go to [helix.sitecore.net](http://helix.sitecore.net).


## Is Habitat a starter kit or template solution?

No. You should not clone this repository for the purposes of starting a new Sitecore project. There are other community solutions which can be used as a starter for Helix-based Sitecore implementations. Habitat is intended as a **reference example** of a Helix-based Sitecore implementation.

## Is Habitat supported by Sitecore?

Sitecore maintains the Helix documentation and Habitat example, but Habitat code is not supported by Sitecore Product Support Services. Please do not submit support tickets regarding Habitat.
